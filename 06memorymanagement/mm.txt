1. malloc and dealloc happens automatically, no manual handling

MEMORY MANAGEMENT 

new()

allocate memory but no initialisation
you will get a memory address
zeroed storage -> zeroed storage means memory is initialized to the zero value of its type (e.g., 0 for numbers, "" for strings, nil for pointers). This happens with new, make, or variable declarations.
make() 
cant put any data to it initially

allocates memory and initialises it with a value on our behalf so that we can use the variable
you will get a memory address
non-zeroed storage -> Non-zeroed storage refers to memory that isn't pre-initialized (e.g., via unsafe or custom memory management), and its contents may contain arbitrary (garbage) data, leading to potential undefined behavior.
can put any data desired by user.


MEMORY MANAGAMENT

GC automatically happend
anything oos or nil is eligible for GC.
